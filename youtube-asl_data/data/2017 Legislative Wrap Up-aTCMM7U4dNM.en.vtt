00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.620
The legislative special session is finally over and the Governor has taken action on the bills,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so we can now tell you what was accomplished at the Legislature this year.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.000
The Commission succeeded in getting many of our bills passed.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Thanks to all who advocated for the bills.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.760
The Commission’s legislative agenda comes from the community and is set by commission members.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.000
Your participation made a difference!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.260
Thanks to the legislators and citizen advocates who fought long and hard

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.000
on our behalf to help us get our bills passed.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.440
Here’s what we accomplished together:

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.560
Education: Increased funding for Deaf Mentor Family Program: Passed

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The Deaf Mentor Family Program will receive an increase in grant funding

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
from the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services Division (DHHSD).

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.440
DHHSD will decide how large the increase is.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.000
Age-Related Hearing Loss: Require good acoustics and hearing loops in state-funded construction: Passed

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
From now on, whenever the state helps pay for construction or remodeling of a public gathering space

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in which it’s important to be able to hear, contractors will be required

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.340
to consider including good acoustics and hearing loops.
They can waive the requirements if it is too expensive.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.320
This new law is the first in the nation and sets a new national standard for accessibility.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.840
Age-Related Hearing Loss: Training for staff at assisted living facilities: Passed

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This new law clarifies that many staff who work with senior citizens can take training

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.920
about age-related hearing loss and have it count towards their training requirements.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.460
The Commission will bring together a group of stakeholders to develop the training.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.020
The group will include Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services Division,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.420
audiologists, and the University of Minnesota.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.000
The student group at the College of Audiology at the U has agreed to develop

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
an online version of the training and the U has agreed to host the online training.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The bill goes into effect on January 1, 2018.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.000
Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services Division (DHHSD): Modernize the services and increase funding: Passed

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.300
The new law will modernize the way services are provided statewide for deaf, deafblind

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.380
and hard of hearing adults and children across the state and increase the funding for DHHSD.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.660
We will provide more details about this new law in the next few weeks.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Strengthening Commission: Increase funding to expand Commission’s impact

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.900
for advocating with deaf, deafblind and hard of hearing Minnesotans: Passed

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.000
Funding for the Commission will be increased by $370,000 per year.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
This will allow us to put more information into American Sign Language (ASL),

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.760
continue our work on age-related hearing loss,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.720
and spend more time ensuring that laws are implemented the way they should be.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Education: Funding for Adult Basic Education at ThinkSelf: Not Passed

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.000
The Legislature did not increase the funding for the Adult Basic Education (ABE) programs in Minnesota.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
This year the Deaf ABE program partnered with other programs

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.800
in the state to ask for an increase for all of them.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.780
Unfortunately, they were not successful.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:41.280
Education: Funding and infrastructure for the Minnesota State Academies for the Deaf and Blind: Passed

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The State Academies will receive almost everything they asked the Legislature for.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The Education Budget bill includes an increase of almost $2.8 million

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
for the State Academies over the next two years, which will allow them to add staff and update resources.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.000
They will also receive over $2 million to maintain and update buildings

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
on the campuses and to increase safety for students on campus.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.700
They had also asked for money to build a track on campus, but this did not pass.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:32.000
Part of the funding increase for the State Academies will continue in future years, but not all of it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.220
They will need to go back to the Legislature and ask again for an increase in funding in 2019.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.480
Education: Assistive Technology in Education: Passed

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The Minnesota Department of Education is required to do an analysis

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.600
of how assistive technology is used by students with disabilities.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:05.000
They must give the legislature a report of their findings in February 2018.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.360
Employment: Eliminate waiting lists for Vocational Rehabilitation Services: Passed

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.740
Vocational Rehabilitation Services will receive an additional $3.5 million per year

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.540
which will help ensure that people with disabilities do not have to wait

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:34.000
if they need assistance in finding a job or in getting the support they need once they have a job.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.460
Thank you to the people who responded to our Action Alert and contacted legislators to support this.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.660
You were a big help!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Employment: Keep Accommodation Fund for State Employees: Good and Bad Parts Passed

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The Accommodation Fund for state employees will continue to receive $200,000 per year.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.540
However, the new law also requires agencies to pay half of the cost for accommodations.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:21.000
This is a new policy that we tried to convince legislators to change, but we were not successful.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.520
Communication Access: Limitations on requirements to make websites available:

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.440
Not Passed, which is good news.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.020
Early in the session, we were worried that the Legislature would introduce

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.800
a bill or an amendment that would say

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.620
that businesses do not have to make their websites accessible.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:54.440
Luckily, none of the legislators offered this bill or amendment this year.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.520
Elections: Changes to accessible voting equipment: Not Passed, which is fine.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.860
There was a bill that would have changed the law to allow for a new type

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.000
of accessible voting equipment to be used on Election Day in Minnesota.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.060
If it passed, we wanted to be sure the bill included a policy to protect

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.880
the secrecy of who each person voted for.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:34.660
However, the bill did not pass so the special policy to protect voters’ secrecy is not needed.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.820
Over the next few weeks, we will provide more detailed information

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.000
about several of the bills that passed this year.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.280
Stay tuned!

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.700
